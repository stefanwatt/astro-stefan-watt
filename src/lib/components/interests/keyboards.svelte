        This is the Iris Rev. 2. It's the first one I've built.

      <ul class="list-disc px-6 font-light">
        <li>54 keys (Regular Full-Size-Board has about double the keys)</li>
        <li>column staggered because your fingers have different lengths</li>
        <li>tented for more natural wrist angle</li>
        <li>Micro-USB (to PC) + TRRS (between halves)</li>
        <li>Workman Layout because QWERTY just makes no sense at all</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-4">
        I built this from scratch. The case is 3D-printed. It really has revolutionized the way I think about keyboards. At first it was challenging to live with this only about half the keys. Now I don't even use the top-most row and the outer-most column. So I can actually live with about 36 keys. That means I never have to move my fingers more than one column/row from the home row. All the missing characters are accessed through layers (hold backspace + X/M/V = Number 1/2/3).
